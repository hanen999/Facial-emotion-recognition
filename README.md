# Facial-emotion-recognition
It will be amazing if machines become emotionally intelligent enough to make decisions based on people's emotions that can be detected by computer vision. We can distinguish between two types of face analysis. Using a sequential approach, we may determine whether anything is a face based on facial traits, which are static. Is it a person? What age is it? Is it a man or a woman? Additionally, the facial state is dynamic. We can choose whether it is shocked or incensed Depending on the application, face emotion recognition systems may employ offline data or real-time input. In this paper, we're going to use a convolutional neural network to create and test a real-time facial recognition model. There is a lot of interest in this field, many people want to take part in Artificial Intelligence research, but they don't have the resources necessary to do so. Thus, we will lead them to Google Colab as a cloud-based solution without having to download or install anything on their hardware, as well as free GPU and TPU usage.
